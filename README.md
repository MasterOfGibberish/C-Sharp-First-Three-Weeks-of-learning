# C-Sharp-Learning-First-Week
First steps mastering C#!

Learning to program. First steps mastering C#! I have taken the Vilnius Coding School C# programming course (which lasted 9 weeks in total) from Vilnius CODING School! Thus, this is the code from the first three weeks.
P.S. some of the code does not work (because it is a learning process), I had saved that because I wanted to save my code.
